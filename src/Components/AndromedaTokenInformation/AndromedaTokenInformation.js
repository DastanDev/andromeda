        <h2>ANDROMEDA TOKEN</h2>

        <h3>GENERAL INFORMATION.</h3>

        <p>The aim of the project is to create a safe
        place for Binance Smart Chain, further
        called “BSC”, investors, by enabling
        high-quality project verification.
        Andromeda Exchange is the first place
        that will make sure BSC project is 100%
        safe and legitimate, this way investors
        can feel much more secured while
        investing their funds into one of them.
        Also, we will enable easy-to-use BSCtoken
        generator, with much cheaper price.</p>

        <h3>ANDROMEDA SECURITY.</h3>

        <p>Our plan to secure investors will be done
        in 2 phases.
        Phase 1 will be a very detailed
        KYC process of every token developer that
        will want to be listed on our exchange.
        Phase 2 will be a request of deposit of at
        least 50% of the liquidity value, which will
        be then shown on exchange directly as part of “safety score”. <br />
          <br />
        In case of any illegal action from token
        developer, like rug pull for example, we
        will then refund at least 50% of the initial
        investment to a victim of that token, that
        will make his purchase via our platform.
        Token developer can choose between
        50% to 100% of liquidity value as for
        deposit amount.
        </p>

        <h3>ANDROMEDA ECOSYSTEM.</h3>

        <p>Thanks to our platform you will be able to
        exchange one BSC token into another with
        just one click, however if you choose to
        pay with Andromeda Token you will
        receive a better rate of swap.
        Token
        generator will be created with
        user-friendly GUI, will also not be
        expensive like every token generator is.
        We will also provide a detailed education
        panel about creating your token and taking care of it.</p>

        <h3>TOKEN DISTRIBUTION.</h3>
        <p>All the Andromeda Tokens are pre-mined;
        hence Andromeda Token is not mineable.
        The main distribution of Andromeda
        Token will happen during Launchpad ICO,
        before that, the equivalent of 2% total
        supply will be distributed for pre-sales.
        There is another 0.1% of total supply
        planned for airdrops/events to
        be distributed. <br />
          <br />
        Max supply of Andromeda Token is
        1,000,000,000,000,000  from which
        50% of the supply was burned at the start.
        That means total supply is
        500,000,000,000,000 and part of it
        will be burned manually.
        </p>
